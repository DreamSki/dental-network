    h4 Delta Dental plans focus on preventive care, educating members on the importance of these benefits that are often covered at 100%. Dental benefits work because most dental disease is preventable. Encouraging our subscribers to visit the dentist regularly results in restorative services being necessary only when signs of more advanced dental disease are detected.
    p ° Medical plans operate under a different model, focusing on treatment versus prevention. Medical insurers put more resources toward covering the costly consequences of injury and illness after they occur, thus increasing the overall cost of medical coverage.
    p ° If the dental plan is bundled or embedded with medical, it may be subject to high medical deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums.

h4 Regardless of the dental plan you choose, making the decision to secure dental coverage for your family is the right choice. People with dental coverage exhibit healthier behaviors and better oral health habits – including brushing with fluoride tooth paste twice a day, flossing daily and visiting the dentist regularly.
